# Attendance Project using face recognition library

## Description:
The program starts by reading the training list of images. Next, the encoding of the images is figured out using the face recognition library and then the encoding is used for similarity detection. Finally, when the similarity is found, the name is read to an attendance CSV file.

## Dataset:
Images of my collogues in the SPICED Academy Cohort.
